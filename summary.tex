\noindent I have over seven years of professional EMC experience on top of my experience with general electrical and electronics engineering, both via formal education and personal projects, I believe the knowledge and skills built up during this time make me the perfect candidate for the role, One of my personal projects is to build an electric go-kart for my two children, this is being designed to be a frame welded from 20mm square box, and MDF sheet, the motors for it are recovered from “Hoverboards”, the control electronics will be bespoke with custom ESCs.
\\
\\
A work-based solution I delivered was involved with the testing of Traction Inverters for EMC and functional testing, the motors they are designed to drive are 100 kW 400 V brushless motors, meaning at full load they can draw up to 400 A peak, this makes it hard to source the required power. The solution I implemented was to use two traction inverters and two traction motors, and couple the motors mechanically together. One motor would be used as an electronic load, and the other would be running in regeneration mode, applying torque and providing about 80\% of the required electrical energy to the first, this meant that the current provided by the external PSUs could be vastly reduced.
\\
\\
I also implemented a standardisation on the Amphenol Industrial PL282 series of connectors for use in testing, this allows test set-ups to be quicker to set up and modify while ensuring safe isolation and containment for operators from HaV.
\\
\\
In my time consulting for Energym, I have already managed to make a number of suggestions that will improve the reliability of their product and reduce failure rates, coupled with design suggestions allow them to supply customers in both the Fitness Studio, and home markets, and implement functionality not seen on their competitor's products.
\\
\\
I am actively working towards professional registration through the IET, with a view to becoming a chartered engineer.
\\
\\
% If I were successful in my application to take up this position, I believe I would bring my experience as an Engineer, as well as my ability to come up with unconventional solutions, or at least ask the questions that inspire others to come up with unorthodox solutions.
